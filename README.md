Book Tracker

In many elementary schools, students are required to read a large number of books and periodically report to the teacher what books have been read.  This application allows a parent to create an account for their child that can be logged into and out of, list books that have been read, view a list of those books, and update or delete any books listed.

Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

gem 'book_tracker'
And then execute:

$ bundle
Or install it yourself as:

$ gem install book_tracker

Development

After checking out the repo, run bin/setup to install dependencies. You can also run bin/console for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run bundle exec rake install. To release a new version, update the version number in version.rb, and then run bundle exec rake release, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the .gem file to rubygems.org.
